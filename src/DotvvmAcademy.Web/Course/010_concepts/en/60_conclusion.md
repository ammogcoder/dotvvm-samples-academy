Congratulations! You have learned the basic concepts of DotVVM!

## Summary

- Every page in DotVVM consists of a View and a ViewModel. We are using the MVVM design pattern.
- Views define what the users can see and interact with.
- ViewModels keep the state of the page and handle user actions.
- DotHTML extends plain HTML with directives, binding expressions and controls.

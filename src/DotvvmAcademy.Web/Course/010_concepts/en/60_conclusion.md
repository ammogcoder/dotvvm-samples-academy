## Summary

- DotVVM is an MVVM web framework.
- Views are what the users interact with.
- ViewModels contain data and logic for Views to use.
- Models are whatever ViewModels use to get the job done (i.e. databases, payment gates, mailing clients, etc).
- Dothtml is made (roughly) of Directives, Bindings, and Controls.

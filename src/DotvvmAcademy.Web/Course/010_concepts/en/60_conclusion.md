# Conclusion

Congratulations! You learned the basic concepts of DotVVM!

---

## Summary

- DotVVM is an MVVM web framework.
- Views are what the users interact with.
- ViewModels contain data and logic for Views to use.
- Dothtml is made (roughly) of Directives, Bindings, and Controls.

> Note: Models are usually external services with their own logic and data (i.e. databases, payment gates, mailing clients, etc).

# The ViewModel

Hello and welcome to DotVVM Academy. Let's build a simple counter! It will allow users to increment and decrement a value in steps they define.

__DotVVM__ is a web framework based on the _Model-View-ViewModel_ (MVVM) pattern.

__ViewModels__ are just plain old C# classes that contain the page's data and logic. They get sent between the application and its users.

## Tasks

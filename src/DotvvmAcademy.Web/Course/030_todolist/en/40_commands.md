# Commands

You can't add or remove todo items list unless there's a command that does that, right?

- Add a `NewItem` string property.
- Add an `Add` method. This method needs to add `NewItem` to `Items`.
- Add a `Remove` method that takes a string parameter. It removes the parameter from `Items`.

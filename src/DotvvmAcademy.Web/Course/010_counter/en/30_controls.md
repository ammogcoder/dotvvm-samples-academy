# Controls

_Controls_ are DotVVM's reusable components. You access them using the `dot` prefix.

```dothtml
<dot:TextBox Text="{value: Difference}" />
```
The `TextBox` control is essentially an `<input>` element that allows you to use bindings.

---

## Tasks

- Add a `TextBox` control to the `<body>` element.
- Value-bind it to the `Difference` property.

# Moving properties

Hello and, again, welcome to DotVVM Academy! 

_DataContext_ or also _Binding Context_ is the target of every binding you make. You can use it to shorten your bindings and hide parts of the View.

## Tasks

- Move the `FirstName` and `LastName` property to the `Profile` class.
- Create a property of type `Profile` also called `Profile` in the ViewModel.
